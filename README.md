# Numerical-methods
Here are collected implemented by me different algorithms for numerical methods including:
1) Function approximation by the power series on a example of hyperbolic function 'sinh'
2) SOLVING EQUATIONS WITH ONE UNKNOWN:
   * Method of Successive Approximations 
   * Newton-Raphson method

3)
4)
5)
6)
