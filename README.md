# Numerical-methods
Here are collected implemented by me different algorithms for numerical methods including:
1) FUNCTION APPROXIMATION:
   * by the power series on a example of hyperbolic function 'sinh'
2) SOLVING EQUATIONS WITH ONE UNKNOWN:
   * Method of Successive Approximations 
   * Newton-Raphson method
3) SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS SOLVING:
   * Iterative method
   * Gaussian elimination
4) NUMERICAL INTEGRATION:
   * by Composite Simpson's rule

   # Note:
   _Just as an example was used integrand x*((2 * cos(x / 2)) - x / 2 * sin(x / 2)) ;
   You are free to add whatever integrand you'd like to calculate just replacing default integrand and corresponding origin
   with your values;_
